# VehicleTestingSystem

Objective:
Simulate testing scenarios for vehicles, such as load capacity, terrain handling, and durability.

Features:
Test vehicles under various load and terrain conditions.
Generate performance reports with pass/fail metrics.
Suggest improvements based on test results.

OOP Concepts Used:
Encapsulation: Classes like Vehicle, TestScenario, and TestResult encapsulate related attributes and behaviors.
Inheritance: Extend TestScenario into specific tests like LoadTest, TerrainTest, and DurabilityTest. Polymorphism: Implement different testing methods for various vehicle types.
